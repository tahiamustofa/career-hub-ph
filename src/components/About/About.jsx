                <p>  I am an Junior Front-end Developer and a teacher! My target is to build things following the latest trends and 
                    technologies. And definitely, my other primary goal is to find solutions to the problems. My grasp of limitless learning 
                    brought me to web programming. Because I love exploring new things and in this field, there is no end to learning. Currently,
                     I am learning Core design, and also have a thirst for learning AI as well as other things. Currently, I am looking for an opportunity
                      as a Teacher in my specialties. I am a team player and self-motivated, always a grasp for learning new stacks.</p>
